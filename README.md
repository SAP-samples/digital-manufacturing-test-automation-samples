Using the sample artifacts provided will allow you to learn and understand how to build your own automated testcases for SAP Digital Manufacturing and is not covered by SAP Support.

## Description
SAP will share TOSCA test automation modules for the standard applications of Digital Manufacturing. These modules can be downloaded and imported to any Tricentis TOSCA (V. 2023.2.x or above) environment for building your own test automation suites.

Current available test automation modules you can find in the Folder Module.
Modules will be named as the respective Digital Manufacturing Application Name with the extension .TSU e.g. Manage Orders.tsu
Each TSU File contains relevant modules for this app. The modules support the SAP standard UI. 

Published samples might not cover all variants needed for your test case. Additional functions you should enhance in your learning/ project activities. Additional Modules might be added in future.

## Download and Import Samples
